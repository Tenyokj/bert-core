**BERT**
is an upgradeable DAO voting & grant system that turns community proposals into funded outcomes. Users submit ideas, vote with stake, and receive transparent, on-chain grant distribution.

Users can create proposals in the Idea Registry, participate in structured voting rounds, and see winners funded through the pool. Reputation and voter progression reward consistent contributors, while role-based permissions protect critical actions.

Note: Please read the Contract [Documentation](https://docs.bert.dao) before integrating with this repo.

**Key Features**
1. End-to-end grant flow: ideas -> voting -> funding -> distribution
2. Transparent, verifiable state transitions for every idea
3. Reputation and progression to reward consistent contributors
4. Role-based permissions to protect critical actions
5. Upgradeable core modules for long-term evolution

**Why BERT**
1. Focused on outcomes: clear rules from proposal to payout
2. Community-driven: voting with stake aligns incentives
3. Built for growth: upgradeable modules and role governance

**Use Cases**
1. Community grant programs
2. DAO ecosystem funding rounds
3. Hackathon or builder reward pools
